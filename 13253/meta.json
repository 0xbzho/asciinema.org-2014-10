The situation has improved somewhat since then, but the script still has a lot of practical value. It will do the following when run on a newly-provisioned RamNode OpenVZ host: purge lots of default cruft, add some new mirrors, update system packages, install some common and useful tools, harden the system, and setup a non-root admin user. After which, the system can be used as a light, secure and up-to-date platform for whatever purposes you intend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the code | \u003ca href=\"http://tuxhelp.org/scripts/ramnode-bootstrap.html\"\u003ehttp://tuxhelp.org/scripts/ramnode-bootstrap.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nDirect link | \u003ca href=\"http://files.tuxhelp.org/scripts/ramnode-bootstrap.sh\"\u003ehttp://files.tuxhelp.org/scripts/ramnode-bootstrap.sh\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","Time":"2014-10-25T06:24:30Z","Tags":["Linux","bash","xterm"]}
